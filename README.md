/ Mode Calculator /
4 modes: add, subtract, multiply and divide
User can input two numbers and select any above mode of operation to calculate result
- Especially efficient for sum of values i.e., groceries :)
- Pressing Enter alse evaluates the result
- Generic UI
TODOs:
1. Keyboard inputs and calculation
2. Backspace feature (requires bit of refactoring)
3. Equal button to continously get outputs without entering a new number
